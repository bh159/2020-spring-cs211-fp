For this final project I'm going to implement a texas hold'em sytled game.

This game will feature:  

-real win/lose logic  
-current hand win percentage updated in real time  
-AI players who are reactive and have limited individual personalities  
-betting  

Win condition: be the last player remaining.

IF I have time I would like to implement additional features such as:  
-AI character depth with possible lines to say to the player (showing possible tells)  
  -possible set player responses?  
-implemented in a 3D environment (with unity's help)  
-possible tools for the player to purchase to "help" win unwinnable hands (extra Ace in sleeve etc.)  
-win/loss history
